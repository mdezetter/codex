# Codedex

These are all of my files from the tutorials on [Codedex.io](https://www.codedex.io/). 
Each repository is a section, currently there are 7 sections: 
1. Hello World
2. Variables
3. Control Flow
4. Loops
5. Lists
6. Functions
7. Classes & Objects

I'm working my way through these tutorials in order to gain a better understanding of Python!
